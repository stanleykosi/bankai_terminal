POLYMARKET DOCUMENTATION


# What is Polymarket?

Polymarket is the worldΓÇÖs largest prediction market, allowing you to stay informed and profit from your knowledge by betting on future events across various topics.

Studies show prediction markets are often more accurate than pundits because they combine news, polls, and expert opinions into a single value that represents the market's view of an event's odds. Our markets reflect *accurate, unbiased, and real-time probabilities* for the events that matter most to you. Markets seek truth.

## Quick Overview

* On Polymarket, you can [buy and sell shares](making-your-first-trade) representing future event outcomes (i.e. "Will TikTok be banned in the U.S. this year?")

* Shares in event outcomes are [always priced](what-is-polymarket/#understanding-prices) between 0.00 and 1.00 [USDC](../FAQ/why-do-i-need-crypto/#why-usdc), and every pair of event outcomes (i.e. each pair of "YES" + "NO" shares) is fully collateralized by \$1.00 USDC.

* Shares are created when [opposing sides come to an agreement on odds](../trading/limit-orders), such that the sum of what each side is willing to pay is equal to \$1.00.

* The shares representing the *correct, final outcome* are paid out \$1.00 USDC each upon [market resolution](../markets/how-are-markets-resolved).

* Unlike sportsbooks, you are not betting against "the house" ΓÇô the counterparty to each trade is another Polymarket user. As such:

  * Shares can be sold before the event outcome is known\_ (i.e. to lock in profits or cut losses)

  * *There is no "house" to ban you for winning too much.*

### Understanding Prices

Prices = Probabilities.

<VideoPlayer src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0CvPEYBzTI?si=9cirMPQ72orQzLyS" />

*Prices (odds) on Polymarket represent the current probability of an event occurring.* For example, in a market predicting whether the Miami Heat will win the 2025 NBA Finals, if YES shares are trading at 18 cents, it indicates a 18% chance of Miami winning.

These odds are determined by what price other Polymarket users are currently willing to buy & sell those shares at. Just how stock exchanges don't "set" the prices of stocks, Polymarket does not set prices / odds - they're a function of supply & demand.

[Learn more >](/docs/guides/trading/how-are-prices-calculated)

### Making money on markets

In the example above, if you believe Miami's chances of winning are higher than 18%, you would buy ΓÇ£YesΓÇ¥ shares at 18 cents each. If Miami wins, each ΓÇ£YesΓÇ¥ share would be worth \$1, resulting in an 82-cent profit per share. Conversely, any trader who owned ΓÇ£NoΓÇ¥ shares would see their investment become worthless once the game is over.

Since it's a market, you're not locked into your trade. You can sell your shares at any time at the current market price. As the news changes, the supply and demand for shares fluctuates, causing the share price to reflect the new odds for the event.

### How accurate are Polymarket odds?

Research shows prediction markets are often more accurate than experts, polls, and pundits. Traders aggregate news, polls, and expert opinions, making informed trades. Their economic incentives ensure market prices adjust to reflect true odds as more knowledgeable participants join.

This makes prediction markets the best source of real-time event probabilities. People use Polymarket for the most accurate odds, gaining the ability to make informed decisions about the future.

If you're an expert on a certain topic, Polymarket is your opportunity to profit from trading based on your knowledge, while improving the market's accuracy.

# Large Cross Chain Deposits

**For deposits over \$50,000 we recommended to use bridges and ensure minimal fee's (slippage).**

## Recommended Bridges

* [DeBridge](https://app.debridge.finance/?inputChain=1\&outputChain=137\&inputCurrency=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\&outputCurrency=0x3c499c542cef5e3811e1192ce70d8cc03d5c3359\&dlnMode=simple)
* [Across](https://app.across.to/bridge?)
* [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/)

For large deposits (>\$50,000) originating from a chain other than Polygon, we recommend using one of the aforementioned bridges. Ensure you bridge to your Polymarket USDC (Polygon) [deposit address](https://polymarket.com/wallet) (screenshot below). Please be mindful of potential slippage during the transaction.

<Warning>
  Polymarket is not affiliated with, responsible for, or makes any guarantees regarding any third-party bridge. Users are advised to review the Terms of Use or other relevant documentation for third-party bridges.
</Warning>

## Important Notes

You can deposit USDC or USDC.e to your Polymarket Polygon wallet.

If you deposit USDC (native), you will be prompted to "activate funds," which will swap this to USDC.e via the lowest fee Uniswap pool, ensuring slippage of less than 10 basis points (bps).

If you encounter any issues with the deposit process, please reach out to us on Discord for assistance.


# How to Withdraw

> How to withdraw your cash balance from Polymarket.

Withdrawing from Polymarket is simple, instant, and free.

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Go to the Polymarket funds page and click on the **Withdraw** button.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Enter the USDC address you wish to withdraw to. Make sure the address
    supports USDC on the Polygon network. Then, enter the amount you want to
    withdraw.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Click **Withdraw**. Your funds will be transferred instantly.
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAXn0LCPTgA?si=JsYilGM3h0jSNBZa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

<Note>
  Note: When withdrawing USDC.e (bridged USDC) is swapped through the [Uniswap v3 pool](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd36ec33c8bed5a9f7b6630855f1533455b98a418)
  for USDC (native) (the UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output
  amount). At times, this pool may be exhausted and for extremely large deposits
  there might not be enough liquidity. If you are having withdraw issues, try
  breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be
  rebalanced. Additionally, you can select to withdraw USDC.e directly which
  does not require any Uniswap liquidity; just be aware that some exchanges no
  longer allow USDC.e to be deposited directly.
</Note>


# How Are Markets Created?

> Markets are created by the markets team with input from users and the community.

## Can I create my own market?

While users cannot directly create their own markets, they are encouraged to suggest ideas for new markets. In choosing which markets to list, Polymarket considers the following factors:

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Is there enough demand for trading in the market to produce an accurate probability? Polymarket targets \$X in trading volume as a minimum.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Is there social good or news value in understanding the probability generated by the market?
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Can the market be resolved clearly?
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Is there a credible information source for market resolution?

    *For example, a countryΓÇÖs elections commission can be specified as the official resolution source for an election.*
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Can the market be resolved in a definitive time frame?
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### Submit your market proposal

To give your proposal the best chance of being listed, include as much information as possible, such as:

* What is the market title?
* What is the [resolution source](../markets/how-are-markets-resolved)?
* Evidence of demand for trading that market

The best ways to propose a new market are:

* On [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket) in the **#market-suggestion** channel
* On Twitter / X by tagging [@polymarket](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I+have+an+idea+for+a+new+market+@polymarket)


# How Are Prices Calculated?

> The prices probabilities displayed on Polymarket are the midpoint of the bid-ask spread in the orderbook.

## Initial Price

* When a market is created, there are initially zero shares and no pre-defined prices or odds.

* Market makers (a fancy term for traders placing limit orders) interested in buying YES or NO shares can place [Limit Orders](../trading/limit-orders) at the price they're willing to pay

* When offers for the YES and NO side equal \$1.00, the order is "matched" and that \$1.00 is converted into 1 YES and 1 NO share, each going to their respective buyers.

For example, if you place a limit order at \$0.60 for YES, that order is matched when someone places a NO order at \$0.40. *This becomes the initial market price.*

<Important>Polymarket is not a "bookie" and does not set prices / odds. Prices are set by what Polymarket users are currently willling to buy/sell shares at. All trades are peer-to-peer.</Important>

## Future Price

The prices displayed on Polymarket are the midpoint of the bid-ask spread in the orderbook ΓÇö unless that spread is over \$0.10, in which case the last traded price is used.

Like the stock market, prices on Polymarket are a function of realtime supply & demand.

<VideoPlayer src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0CvPEYBzTI?si=9cirMPQ72orQzLyS" />

### Prices = Probabilities

In the market below, the probability of 37% is the midpoint between the 34┬ó bid and 40┬ó ask. If the bid-ask spread is wider than 10┬ó, the probability is shown as the last traded price.

<Frame>
  <img className="block w-full h-auto dark:hidden" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} noZoom src="https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/how_are_prices_calculated.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>You may not be able to buy shares at the displayed probability / price because there is a bid-ask spread. In the above example, a trader wanting to buy shares would pay 40┬ó for up to 4,200 shares, after which the price would rise to 43┬ó.</Note>


# How Are Prediction Markets Resolved?

> Markets are resolved by the UMA Optimistic Oracle, a smart-contract based optimistic oracle.

## Overview

* When the result of a market becomes clear, the market can be ΓÇ£resolved,ΓÇ¥ or permanently finalized.

* Markets are resolved according to the market's pre-defined rules, which can be found under market's the order book.

* When a market is resolved, holders of winning shares receive \$1 per share, losing shares become worthless, and trading of shares is no longer possible.

* To resolve a market, an outcome must first be ΓÇ£proposed,ΓÇ¥ which involves putting up a bond in USDC.e which will be forfeited if the proposal is unsuccessful.

* If the proposal is validated as accurate, the proposer will receive a reward for your proposal.

<Warning>
  If you propose a market too early, or are unsuccessful in your proposal, you will lose all of your \$750 bond. Do not propose a resolution unless you understand the process and are confident in your view.
</Warning>

### To propose a market resolution

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Navigate to the market you want to propose and click Resolution > Propose Resolution.

    <Note>You will be taken to the corresponding UMA oracle page for the market, which shows the bond required and reward for successful proposal.</Note>
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Ensure that you have enough USDC.e in your wallet on Polygon to supply the bond (usually \$750)
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Select the outcome you would like to propose from the drop-down menu.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Connect your wallet and submit the transaction. It will now enter the UMA OracleΓÇÖs verification queue.
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

Once in the verification process, UMA will review the transaction to ensure it was proposed correctly. If approved, you will receive your bond amount back in your wallet plus the reward. If not approved, it will enter UmaΓÇÖs dispute resolution process, which is described in detail here.

### To dispute a proposed resolution

Once a market is proposed for resolution it goes into a challenge period of 2 hours.

If you do not agree with a proposed resolution, you can [dispute the outcome](../markets/dispute).


# How Are Markets Clarified?

> How are markets on Polymarket clarified?

## Overview

* Markets are resolved according to the rules set forth on the market page.

* The rules specify the resolution source, the market end date, and they outline how the market should resolve in various edge-cases.

* The market title describes the market, but the rules define how it should be resolved.

<Important>It is important to read the rules before trading in a market. </Important>

## Clarifications

In rare cases, circumstances occur that were not foreseen at a marketΓÇÖs creation and it becomes necessary to clarify rules after trading has begun. In these cases Polymarket may issue an ΓÇ£Additional contextΓÇ¥ update to the rules.

<Tip>If you believe a clarification is necessary for a market, the best place to request a clarification is in the [Polymarket Discord](https://discord.com/invite/polymarket) **#market-review** channel.</Tip>

# How Are Markets Disputed?

**Anyone can dispute a proposed market resolution if they feel it was proposed in error.**

Once a market is proposed for resolution it goes into a challenge period of 2 hours.

If no one challenges the proposal the resolution is deemed valid and the proposer receives their bond back plus the reward.

During the 2-hour challenge period, anyone may dispute the proposal on the [UMA dapp](https://oracle.uma.xyz/) by posting a challenge bond of the same amount as the proposer bond (usually \$750).

This begins the debate period of 24-48 hours (votes happen every other day and there will always be at least 24 hours for discussion). Anyone wishing to contribute evidence to the discussion can do so in the Uma Discord server in the #evidence-rationale and #voting-discussion channels.

After the debate period, Uma token holders vote (this process takes approximately 48 hours) and one of four outcomes happens:

## Outcomes

### Proposer wins

Proposer receives their bond back plus half the disputerΓÇÖs bond as a bounty. Disputer loses their bond.

### Disputer wins

Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposerΓÇÖs bond as a bounty. Proposer loses their bond.

### Too Early

This outcome is for proposals for which the underlying event has not yet happened. Eg the result of a sports match that is still ongoing. Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposerΓÇÖs bond as a bounty. Proposer loses their bond.

### Unknown/50-50

This (rarely used) outcome is for events where none of the other options are appropriate. In this case the market price resolves to 50 yes and 50 no. Disputer receives their bond back plus half the proposerΓÇÖs bond as a bounty. Proposer loses their bond.


# Limit Orders

> What are limit orders and how to make them.

## Video guide

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WfpoVGqzbw?si=yvuXC5i08Eik-PnR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

## What are Limit Orders?

Limit orders are open orders (pending trades) that only execute when the market trades at your desired price.

For example, if the highest youΓÇÖre willing to pay for a share of Trump ΓÇ£YesΓÇ¥ in the 2024 Republican Nomination is 72c, but the current market price is 73c, you could create a limit order at 72c and wait until someone is willing to sell Yes shares at your desired price.

<Note>
  ItΓÇÖs not necessary for the entire order to execute at once. Limit orders can ΓÇÿpartially fillΓÇÖ as individual traders fill parts of your order.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    In the buy modal, select **limit** in the order type dropdown.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Enter the price you are willing to buy (or sell, if youΓÇÖve selected to sell) shares at.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Enter the number of shares you want to buy or sell at that price.

    *Optional: Set an expiration date for your limit order. This means that if the order does not execute at your desired price within this timeframe, it will be canceled.*
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Click **Buy** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

    <Note>
      Your limited orders that have yet to be filled are called "Open Orders".
    </Note>
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    You'll see a **ΓÇ£Your deposit is pendingΓÇ¥** screen. You'll receive a confirmation email from Coinbase when your USDC purchase is successful.
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Managing limit orders

When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page.

If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the [Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders).

<Tip>
  Specifically for sports markets, any outstanding limit orders are automatically cancelled once the game begins, clearing the entire order book at the official start time. Be aware, game start times can shift so itΓÇÖs important to always monitor your orders closely in case they are not cleared due to game changes or other circumstances. 
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Additionally, sports markets include a 3-second delay on the placement of marketable orders.
</Tip>

## Canceling limit orders

When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page.

To cancel the order, you can simply click the red **x** button alongside the order.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuA2UdUfZls?si=RUpuzqB9lbBB2pl9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen />

If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the [Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders).

Nice! You can officially call yourself an advanced trader.

# Holding Rewards

## What are we doing?

To keep long-term pricing accurate, we're paying 4.00% annualized Holding Reward based on your total position value in certain polymarkets. We anticipate rolling out a new reward and oracle-resolution system later this year ΓÇö at which point there will be a simple 1-click migration.

## Reward Rate and Conditions

The current rate is set at 4.00% and applies to all eligible positions. This rate is variable and subject to change at Polymarket's discretion. We also reserve the right to introduce limits to the total amount of rewards paid out at any time. This iteration of rewards is funded through the Polymarket Treasury.

Your total position value is randomly sampled once each hour, and the reward is distributed daily. Your rewards are calculated based on the total position value of your eligible positions at the time of evaluation.

### **Total Position Value Computation**

For each eligible polymarket, we calculate the eligible position in the following way:

**Position Valuation**:

* Based on your current "Yes" and "No" shares and the most recent mid-price for each outcome.

### **Example**

If you hold at time of sample:

* 30,000 ΓÇ£YesΓÇ¥ shares at a price of **\$0.53**
* 10,000 ΓÇ£NoΓÇ¥ shares at a price of **\$0.45**

**Total Position Value** =

ΓåÆ `(30000 ├ù 0.53) + (10000 ├ù 0.45)`

ΓåÆ `$15,900 + $4,500 = $20,400`

**Hourly Holding Reward Calculation** (based on 4.00% Annual Reward):

ΓåÆ `$20400 ├ù (0.04 / 365 / 24) Γëê $.09315068493`

## Eligible Events:

Simply put, the more you help the market by placing good orders, the more rewards you earn!

## Seeing Rewards in the Order Book

### Viewing Rewards

The total rewards, max spread, and minimum shares required to earn rewards vary by market. You can view the rewards for a given market in its Order Book.

* On the Polymarket order book, you can hover over the Rewards text to see the amount of rewards available in total on each market.

* The blue highlighted lines correspond to the max spread ΓÇö meaning the farthest distance your limit order can be from the midpoint of the market to earn rewards.

* In the example below, because the max spread is 3c, every order within 3c of the midpoint is eligible for rewards. If the midpoint is \< \$0.10, you need to have orders on both sides to qualify.

# Trading Fees

**Polymarket does not charge any type of fee.**

There are no fees to deposit or withdraw USDC, although intermediaries such as Coinbase, MoonPay, etc may charge transaction fees.

There are no fees to trade shares in any market.


# Does Polymarket Have Trading Limits?

By design, the Polymarket orderbook **does not** have trading size limits. It matches willing buyers and sellers of any amount.

However, there is no guarantee that it will be possible to transact a desired amount of shares without impacting the price significantly, or at all if there are no willing counterparties. Before trading in any market, especially in large size, it is valuable to look at the orderbook to understand depth of liquidity, ie how many buyers or sellers are in the market and their desired trade size and price.


# Using the Order Book

> Understanding the Order Book will help you become an advanced trader.

In the Getting Started tutorial on [Making your First Trade](../get-started/making-your-first-trade/), we learned about market orders.

In a market order, your trade executes instantly at the current market price.

But what if you think the market price is too high and want to set a specific price that you would be willing to accept? These are called [Limit Orders](../trading/limit-orders/).

## Viewing the Order Book

The order book is a list of every open order to buy or sell shares in a particular market.

<Frame>
  <img className="block w-full h-auto dark:hidden" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} noZoom src="https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Orderbook-light.png" />
</Frame>

In this market, **ΓÇ£Presidential Election Winner 2024ΓÇ¥**, we are viewing the order book for Trump <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#E5F8E6', color: '#27AE60', padding: '2px 4px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Yes</span> shares.

The green side represents the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#E5F8E6', color: '#27AE60', padding: '2px 4px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Bids</span>: the highest price traders are willing to pay to buy Trump <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#E5F8E6', color: '#27AE60', padding: '2px 4px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Yes</span>
shares.

The red side represents the <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#FEEEE5', color: '#F55A00', padding: '2px 4px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Asks</span>: the lowest price traders are willing to accept to sell Trump <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#E5F8E6', color: '#27AE60', padding: '2px 4px', borderRadius: '4px' }}>Yes</span> shares.

<Tip>
  Notice that there is a 0.3c gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask price. This is referred to as the spread.
</Tip>

## Managing open orders

When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page.

If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the [Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders).

## Canceling open orders

When you have an open order, you'll find it displayed just below the Order Book on the market's page.

To cancel the order, you can simply click the red **x** button alongside the order.

If you have open orders across multiple markets, you can easily manage and monitor them all from the [Portfolio page](https://polymarket.com/portfolio?tab=Open+orders).

Nice! You can officially call yourself an advanced trader.

# Polymarket vs. Polling

> How is Polymarket better than traditional / legacy polling?

While legacy polls capture a snapshot of opinion at a specific moment, they are often outdated by the time they're publishedΓÇösometimes lagging by several days. In contrast, Polymarket reflects real-time sentiment as events unfold, offering continuous updates and a more dynamic understanding of public opinion.

Studies show that prediction markets like Polymarket tend to outperform traditional pollsters because participants are financially incentivized to be correct. This creates more thoughtful, data-driven predictions. Research by James Surowiecki, author of The Wisdom of Crowds, has highlighted how markets like these can be more accurate than polls due to the "collective intelligence" of diverse participants. Additionally, the Iowa Electronic Markets, an academic research project at the University of Iowa, has consistently demonstrated the superior accuracy of prediction markets like Polymarket over traditional polling in predicting political outcomes.

Polymarket provides a constantly updating picture of public sentiment, offering a degree of accuracy and timeliness that traditional pollsters, who typically report data that is days old, simply cannot match.

**Yes, you can sell or close your position early.**

You may sell shares at any point before the market is resolved by either placing a market order to sell shares at the prevailing bid price in the orderbook, or by placing a limit order for how many shares you wish to sell and at what price.

The limit order will only be executed if/when there is a willing buyer for your shares at the price you set.


# Does Polymarket Have a Token?

**Polymarket does not have a token.**

All trading and liquidity rewards are in USDC, a USD-pegged stablecoin.

</Warning>


# How Do I Export My Key?

> Exporting your private key on Magic.Link

Exporting your private key gives you direct control and security over your funds. This process is applicable if youΓÇÖve signed up via email.

<Warning>
  **DO NOT** share your private key with other parties, platforms, or people. We will never ask for your private key.
</Warning>

1. Access the Export Link while signed into Polymarket: [https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket](https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket)

2. Sign-in on Magic.Link

3. Export Private Key. Once revealed, you should securely store the private key displayed, where others canΓÇÖt access it.

4. Log out of Magic.Link


# Is My Money Safe?

> Yes. Polymarket is non-custodial, so you're in control of your funds.

#### Non-custodial, youΓÇÖre in control

Polymarket recognizes the importance of a trustworthy environment for managing your funds. To ensure this, Polymarket uses non-custodial wallets, meaning we never take possession of your USDC. This approach gives you full control over your assets, providing protection against potential security threats like hacks, misuse, and unauthorized transactions.

### Your keys = your funds

A private key acts like a highly secure password, essential for managing and moving your assets without restrictions. You can export your private key at any time, ensuring sole access to your funds. Learn how to export your private key [here](../FAQ/how-to-export-private-key/).

### Keep your private keys private.

**Do not share your private key with others**. While Polymarket provides the infrastructure, the security of your assets depends on how securely you handle your private key and passwords. Losing your private key or passwords can result in losing access to your funds. It's crucial to store this information in a safe and secure environment.

### Our Commitment

Polymarket aims to give you peace of mind, knowing that your assets are safe and fully under your control at all times. We encourage you to take necessary precautions to secure your digital assets effectively. The ability to manage your private key means you are not reliant on Polymarket to secure your assets; you have the control to ensure your financial security.


# Is Polymarket The House?

> No, Polymarket is not the house. All trades happen peer-to-peer (p2p).

## Polymarket is different in three ways:

### 1. Traders interact directly with each other, not with Polymarket.

Polymarket is a marketplace comprised of traders on both sides of any given market. This means you're always trading with other users, not against a centralized entity or "house." Prices on Polymarket are determined by supply and demand. As traders buy and sell shares in outcomes, prices fluctuate to reflect the collective sentiment and knowledge of market participants.

### 2. Polymarket does not charge trading fees.

Unlike bookmakers or wagering operations, Polymarket does not charge deposit/withdrawal fees, or any type of trading fees. This means that Polymarket does not stand to benefit from the outcome of any market or usage of any trader.

### 3. Transact at any time.

Polymarket enables you to sell your position at any time before the market resolves, provided there is a willing buyer of your shares. This offers flexibility and allows you to manage your risk and lock in profits or cut losses as you see fit.

In essence, Polymarket empowers you to trade based on your own knowledge and research, without going up against a "house" with potentially unfair advantages.


# Why Crypto?

> Why Polymarket uses crypto and blockchain technology to create the worldΓÇÖs largest Prediction market.

Polymarket operates on Polygon, a proof-of-stake layer two blockchain built on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org). All transactions are denominated in USDC, a US-dollar pegged stablecoin.

This architecture offers several advantages over traditional prediction markets:

## Why USDC?

### Stable Value

Polymarket denominates trades in USDC, which is pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. This shields you from the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies and offers a stable medium for trading.

### Regulated Reserves

USDC operates in adherence to regulatory standards and is backed by reserved assets.

### Transparency

Blockchain technology facilitates transparency, as all transactions are recorded publicly.

### Global Reach

Research has shown that wide availability of prediction markets increases their accuracy. Using decentralized blockchain technology removes the need for a central authority in trading, which fosters fairness and open participation around the globe.


# What is a Prediction Market?

> How people collectively forecast the future.

A prediction market is a platform where people can bet on the outcome of future events. By buying and selling shares in the outcomes, participants collectively forecast the likelihood of events such as sports results, political elections, or entertainment awards.

### How it works

Market Prices = Probabilities: The price of shares in a prediction market represents the current probability of an event happening. For example, if shares of an event are trading at 20 cents, it indicates a 20% chance of that event occurring.

### Making predictions

If you believe the actual probability of an event is higher than the market price suggests, you can buy shares. For instance, if you think a team has a better than 20% chance of winning, you would buy shares at 20 cents. If the event occurs, each share becomes worth \$1, yielding a profit.

### Free-market trading

You can buy or sell shares at any time before the event concludes, based on new information or changing circumstances. This flexibility allows the market prices to continuously reflect the most current and accurate probabilities.

### Trust the markets

Prediction markets provide unbiased and accurate probabilities in real time, cutting through the noise of human and media biases. Traditional sources often have their own incentives and slants, but prediction markets operate on the principle of "put your money where your mouth is." Here, participants are financially motivated to provide truthful insights, as their profits depend on the accuracy of their predictions.

In a prediction market, prices reflect the aggregated sentiment of all participants, weighing news, data, expert opinions, and culture to determine the true odds. Unlike media narratives, which can be swayed by various biases, prediction markets offer a transparent view of where people genuinely believe we're heading.

#### Why use prediction markets?

Prediction markets are often more accurate than traditional polls and expert predictions. The collective wisdom of diverse participants, each motivated by the potential for profit, leads to highly reliable forecasts. This makes prediction markets an excellent tool for gauging real-time probabilities of future events.

Polymarket, the world's largest prediction market, offers a user-friendly platform to bet on a wide range of topics, from sports to politics. By participating, you can profit from your knowledge while contributing to the accuracy of market predictions.

#### In addition to detailed comments in the code snippet, here are some more tips to help you get started.

* See the Python example for details on the proper way to initialize a Py-Clob-Client depending on your wallet type. Three exhaustive examples are given. If using a MetaMask wallet or EOA please see the resources [here](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client?tab=readme-ov-file), for instructions on setting allowances.
* When buying into a market you purchase a "Token" that token represents either a Yes or No outcome of the event. To easily get required token pairs for a given event we have provided an interactive endpoint [here](/developers/gamma-markets-api/get-markets).
* Common pitfalls:
  * Negrisk Markets require an additional flag in the OrderArgs `negrisk=False `
  * `invalid signature` error, likely due to one of the following.
    * Incorrect Funder and or Private Key
    * Incorrect NegRisk flag in your order arguments
  * `not enough balance / allowance`.
    * Not enough USDC to perform the trade. See the formula at the bottom of [this](/developers/CLOB/orders/orders) page for details.
    * If using Metamask / WEB3 wallet go [here](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client?tab=readme-ov-file), for instructions on setting allowances.

| **Token**                    | A token represents a stake in a specific Yes/No outcome in a Market. The price of a token can fluctuate between $0 - $1 based on the market belief in the outcome. When a market resolves, the token associated with the correct prediction can be redeemed for \$1 USDC. This is also sometimes called an *Asset Id*                                             |
| **Market**                   | A single event outcome. Corresponds to a pair of CLOB token IDs(Yes/No), a market address, a question ID and a condition ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# API Rate Limits

## How Rate Limiting Works

All rate limits are enforced using Cloudflare's throttling system. When you exceed the maximum configured rate for any endpoint, requests are throttled rather than immediately rejected. This means:

* **Throttling**: Requests over the limit are delayed/queued rather than dropped
* **Burst Allowances**: Some endpoints allow short bursts above the sustained rate
* **Time Windows**: Limits reset based on sliding time windows (e.g., per 10 seconds, per minute)

## General Rate Limits

# Builder Program Introduction

> Learn about Polymarket's Builder Program and how to integrate your platform

## What is a Builder?

In the context of Polymarket, a "builder" refers to a person, group, or organization that routes orders from their customers to Polymarket. For example, if you've created a unique front end that allows your users to place trades on Polymarket via your system, then this guide is for you.

## Builder Program Benefits

The Builders Program currently provides two main benefits:

### 1. Polygon Relayer Access

We expose our Polygon relayer to builders, allowing you to route on-chain transactions through our infrastructure. This means:

* **Polymarket pays for gas fees** on your behalf (when using our Safe Wallets)
* You can deploy *Safe Wallets* for your users and customers

### 2. Trading Attribution

When posting orders to our CLOB exchange, you can add custom headers that identify you as a builder. This enables Polymarket to clearly attribute orders coming from your platform.

High volume builders will be showcased in our upcoming *Builder Leaderboard* allowing Builders to compete for grants from Polymarket.

## Getting Started

Explore the following guides to integrate with the Builders Program:

* [Builder Keys](/developers/builders/builder-profile) - Learn how to generate your Builder Keys and manage your builder profile
* [Order Attribution](/developers/builders/order-attribution) - Learn how to attribute customer orders to your builder account
* [Relayer Client](/developers/builders/relayer-client) - Use the Polygon relayer for gasless transactions and Safe wallet deployment (available in TypeScript and Python)
* [Builder Signing Server](/developers/builders/builder-signing-server) - Set up a secure server for remote signing of builder headers

## Client Libraries

The Builders Program provides official client libraries in multiple languages:

* **TypeScript**: [@polymarket/builder-relayer-client](https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-relayer-client)
* **Python**: [py-builder-relayer-client](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-builder-relayer-client)



# Order Attribution

> Learn how to attribute customer orders to your builder account using authentication headers

## Overview

The order attribution system allows builders to attach custom headers to their customer orders before posting them to the CLOB. These additional headers enable Polymarket to attribute orders to your specific builder account, providing visibility into which orders originate from your platform.

## Builder API Credentials

Each builder will receive Builder API Key Credentials that look like this:

```typescript  theme={null}
interface BuilderApiKeyCreds {
    key: string;
    secret: string;
    passphrase: string;
}

// Example structure
const builderCreds = {
    key: "xxxxx.....",
    secret: "xxxxx.....",
    passphrase: "xxxxx....."
};
```

<Warning>
  **Security Notice**: Your Builder API keys must be kept secure. We provide both local and remote signing methods to help you protect these credentials.
</Warning>

## Signing Methods

There are two methods available for signing orders and adding attribution headers: **Remote Signing** and **Local Signing**.

### Remote Signing (Recommended)

Remote signing is the recommended approach for protecting your Builder API credentials. With this method, your credentials never leave your secure server.

**How it works:**

1. Your customer signs an order payload (ready to be sent to the CLOB)
2. Instead of sending directly to the CLOB, the signed payload is sent to your builder signing server
3. Your builder signing server uses your Builder API keys to cryptographically sign the entire payload and adds the authentication headers
4. The fully signed payload (signed by both your customer and you as the builder) is then sent to the CLOB

**Implementation:**

We provide a complete server implementation in the [@polymarket/builder-signing-server](https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-server) repository.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

// Basic remote signing configuration
const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

// Or with optional authorization token for added security
const builderConfigWithAuth = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign", token: "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"}
});

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
    host,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    creds,
    SignatureType.POLY_PROXY,
    funderAddress,
    undefined,
    false,
    builderConfig // or builderConfigWithAuth
);

// Create and post order - headers are added automatically
const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    price: 0.40,
    side: Side.BUY,
    size: 5,
    tokenID: "27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});

const response = await clobClient.postOrder(order);
```

**Remote Builder Configuration:**

```typescript  theme={null}
interface RemoteBuilderConfig {
    url: string;              // URL of your signing server
    token?: string;           // Optional authorization token
}
```

The optional `token` parameter allows you to add an authorization header to requests sent to your signing server, providing an additional layer of security.

### Local Signing

If you control the entire order placement flow (including signing for your customers), you can sign orders locally before sending them to the CLOB.

**How it works:**

1. Your system creates and signs the order on behalf of your customer
2. Your system uses your Builder API credentials locally to add authentication headers
3. The complete signed order with builder headers is sent directly to the CLOB

**Implementation:**

```typescript  theme={null}
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig, BuilderApiKeyCreds } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

// Configure with local builder credentials
const builderCreds: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
    key: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY!,
    secret: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_SECRET!,
    passphrase: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE!
};

const builderConfig: BuilderConfig = {
    localBuilderCreds: builderCreds
};

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
    host,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    creds,
    SignatureType.POLY_PROXY,
    funderAddress,
    undefined,
    false,
    builderConfig
);

// Create and post order - headers are added automatically
const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    price: 0.40,
    side: Side.BUY,
    size: 5,
    tokenID: "27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});

const response = await clobClient.postOrder(order);
```

## Authentication Headers

The builder signing process adds the following headers to each order request:

* `POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY`: Your builder API key
* `POLY_BUILDER_TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp of when the signature was created
* `POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE`: Your builder passphrase
* `POLY_BUILDER_SIGNATURE`: HMAC signature of the request

These headers are automatically generated and attached by the SDK - you don't need to construct them manually.

## Using Our SDKs

<Info>
  **Important**: We strongly recommend using our official SDKs and server implementations. You **do not** need to implement the signing logic yourself.
</Info>

We provide the following packages to handle all signing and header injection:

* **[@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk](https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-sdk)**: Core signing functionality
* **[@polymarket/builder-signing-server](https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-server)**: Production-ready remote signing server
* **[@polymarket/clob-client](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client)**: Updated CLOB client with built-in builder support

All examples in this documentation use these official packages to ensure security and reliability.

## Next Steps

* Set up your [builder signing server](https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-server) for remote signing
* Review the [complete examples](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client/tree/main/examples) in the CLOB client repository
* Contact [support@polymarket.com](mailto:support@polymarket.com) if you need assistance



# Builder Signing Server

> Self-hosted server for secure remote signing of builder authentication headers

## Overview

The Builder Signing Server is a self-hosted Express.js application that enables remote signing of builder authentication headers. By running this server, you can keep your Builder API credentials secure on your own infrastructure while still allowing your application to sign requests.

<Info>
  This server is designed to work with both the [CLOB Client](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client) for order attribution and the [Relayer Client](/developers/builders/relayer-client) for gasless transactions.
</Info>

## Why Use Remote Signing?

Remote signing provides enhanced security by:

* **Isolating credentials**: Your Builder API keys never leave your secure server
* **Centralized key management**: Manage credentials in one secure location
* **Reduced exposure**: Client applications don't need direct access to sensitive keys

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: v18 or higher
* **yarn** or npm

### Clone and Install

```bash  theme={null}
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Polymarket/builder-signing-server.git
cd builder-signing-server

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Builder API credentials:

```bash  theme={null}
PORT=5001
POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY=your_builder_api_key
POLY_BUILDER_SECRET=your_builder_secret
POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE=your_builder_passphrase
```

<Warning>
  **Security**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of your credentials.
</Warning>

### Port Configuration

You can run the server on any port you choose. The default is `5001`, but you can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable. Make sure to configure your client applications to use the same port:

```typescript  theme={null}
// In your client application
const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});
```

## Running the Server

### Development Mode

For development with automatic reloading:

```bash  theme={null}
yarn start-dev
```

### Production Mode

Build and run the compiled version:

```bash  theme={null}
# Start the production server
yarn start
```

The server will start and display:

```
Builder signing server listening on :5001
```

## Client Integration

### With CLOB Client

Configure the CLOB client to use your signing server for order attribution:

```typescript  theme={null}
import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

const clobClient = new ClobClient(
    host,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    creds,
    SignatureType.POLY_PROXY,
    funderAddress,
    undefined,
    false,
    builderConfig
);

// Orders will automatically use the signing server
const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    price: 0.40,
    side: Side.BUY,
    size: 5,
    tokenID: "27072675915285915455116137912884489109876947142577610372904917850067886308458"
});

const response = await clobClient.postOrder(order);
```

### With Relayer Client

Configure the relayer client to use your signing server for gasless transactions:

```typescript  theme={null}
import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
    remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
});

const relayClient = new RelayClient(
    relayerUrl,
    chainId,
    wallet,
    builderConfig
);

// Transactions will automatically use the signing server
const response = await relayClient.deploySafe();
const result = await response.wait();
```

## Production Deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Issue**: `Error: POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY environment variable is required`

**Solution**: Ensure your `.env` file contains all required variables:

* `POLY_BUILDER_API_KEY`
* `POLY_BUILDER_SECRET`
* `POLY_BUILDER_PASSPHRASE`

### Port Already in Use

**Issue**: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5001`

**Solution**: Change the port in your `.env` file:

```bash  theme={null}
PORT=5002
```

And update your client configuration accordingly.

### Invalid Signature Errors

**Issue**: Client receives invalid signature errors

**Solution**:

1. Verify the request body is being passed correctly as a JSON string
2. Check that the path and method match exactly what the client is sending
3. Ensure your server and client are using the same Builder API credentials

## Quick Start

### Relayer URL

The Polymarket relayer is publicly available at:

```
https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/
```

### Basic Setup

The relayer client is available for both TypeScript and Python:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Ethers v5 theme={null}
  import { ethers } from "ethers";
  import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
  import { BuilderApiKeyCreds, BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

  const relayerUrl = process.env.POLYMARKET_RELAYER_URL;
  const chainId = 137; // Polygon mainnet

  // Create wallet
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

  // Configure builder credentials
  const builderCreds: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
      key: process.env.BUILDER_API_KEY!,
      secret: process.env.BUILDER_SECRET!,
      passphrase: process.env.BUILDER_PASS_PHRASE!
  };

  const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
      localBuilderCreds: builderCreds
  });

  // Initialize client
  const client = new RelayClient(relayerUrl, chainId, wallet, builderConfig);
  ```

  ```typescript Viem theme={null}
  import { createWalletClient, http, Hex } from "viem";
  import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
  import { polygon } from "viem/chains";
  import { RelayClient } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";
  import { BuilderApiKeyCreds, BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

  const relayerUrl = process.env.POLYMARKET_RELAYER_URL;
  const chainId = 137; // Polygon mainnet

  // Create wallet
  const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as Hex);
  const wallet = createWalletClient({
      account,
      chain: polygon,
      transport: http(process.env.RPC_URL)
  });

  // Configure builder credentials
  const builderCreds: BuilderApiKeyCreds = {
      key: process.env.BUILDER_API_KEY!,
      secret: process.env.BUILDER_SECRET!,
      passphrase: process.env.BUILDER_PASS_PHRASE!
  };

  const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
      localBuilderCreds: builderCreds
  });

  // Initialize client
  const client = new RelayClient(relayerUrl, chainId, wallet, builderConfig);
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  import os
  from py_builder_relayer_client.client import RelayClient
  from py_builder_signing_sdk.config import BuilderConfig, BuilderApiKeyCreds

  relayer_url = os.getenv("POLYMARKET_RELAYER_URL")
  chain_id = 137  # Polygon mainnet
  private_key = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")

  # Configure builder credentials
  builder_config = BuilderConfig(
      local_builder_creds=BuilderApiKeyCreds(
          key=os.getenv("BUILDER_API_KEY"),
          secret=os.getenv("BUILDER_SECRET"),
          passphrase=os.getenv("BUILDER_PASS_PHRASE"),
      )
  )

  # Initialize client
  client = RelayClient(relayer_url, chain_id, private_key, builder_config)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Remote Signing

For enhanced security, you can use remote signing to keep your builder credentials on a secure server:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { BuilderConfig } from "@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk";

  const builderConfig = new BuilderConfig({
      remoteBuilderConfig: {url: "http://localhost:3000/sign"}
  });

  const client = new RelayClient(relayerUrl, chainId, wallet, builderConfig);
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  from py_builder_signing_sdk.config import BuilderConfig, RemoteBuilderConfig

  builder_config = BuilderConfig(
      remote_builder_config=RemoteBuilderConfig(
          url="http://localhost:3000/sign"
      )
  )

  client = RelayClient(relayer_url, chain_id, private_key, builder_config)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Core Features

### Deploying Safe Wallets

Deploy a Safe wallet for your user with a single call. Polymarket pays the gas fees:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  const response = await client.deploySafe();
  const result = await response.wait();

  if (result) {
      console.log("Safe deployed successfully!");
      console.log("Transaction Hash:", result.transactionHash);
      console.log("Safe Address:", result.proxyAddress);
  } else {
      console.log("Safe deployment failed");
  }
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  response = client.deploy()
  result = response.wait()

  if result:
      print("Safe deployed successfully!")
      print(f"Transaction Hash: {result.transaction_hash}")
      print(f"Safe Address: {result.proxy_address}")
  else:
      print("Safe deployment failed")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Setting Token Approvals

Set token allowances to enable trading. This example approves USDC spending for the Conditional Token Framework:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { ethers } from "ethers";
  import { Interface } from "ethers/lib/utils";
  import { OperationType, SafeTransaction } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";

  // Define ERC20 approval interface
  const erc20Interface = new Interface([{
      "constant": false,
      "inputs": [
          {"name": "_spender", "type": "address"},
          {"name": "_value", "type": "uint256"}
      ],
      "name": "approve",
      "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "bool"}],
      "payable": false,
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "function"
  }]);

  // Create approval transaction
  function createApprovalTransaction(
      tokenAddress: string,
      spenderAddress: string
  ): SafeTransaction {
      return {
          to: tokenAddress,
          operation: OperationType.Call,
          data: erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData("approve", [
              spenderAddress,
              ethers.constants.MaxUint256
          ]),
          value: "0"
      };
  }

  // Execute the approval
  const usdcAddress = "0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174";
  const ctfAddress = "0x4d97dcd97ec945f40cf65f87097ace5ea0476045";

  const approvalTx = createApprovalTransaction(usdcAddress, ctfAddress);
  const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions(
      [approvalTx],
      "Approve USDC for CTF"
  );

  const result = await response.wait();
  console.log("Approval completed:", result?.transactionHash);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Monitoring Transaction Status

The relayer client provides built-in transaction monitoring:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  // Automatic waiting (recommended)
  const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions(transactions);
  const result = await response.wait();

  if (result) {
      console.log("Transaction confirmed:", result.transactionHash);
      console.log("Transaction state:", result.state);
  } else {
      console.log("Transaction failed or timed out");
  }
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  # Automatic waiting (recommended)
  response = client.execute(transactions, "Transaction metadata")
  result = response.wait()

  if result:
      print(f"Transaction confirmed: {result.transaction_hash}")
      print(f"Transaction state: {result.state}")
  else:
      print("Transaction failed or timed out")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Transaction States

Transactions move through the following states:

* `STATE_NEW`: Transaction received by relayer
* `STATE_EXECUTED`: Transaction executed on-chain
* `STATE_MINED`: Transaction included in a block
* `STATE_CONFIRMED`: Transaction confirmed (final state)
* `STATE_FAILED`: Transaction failed (terminal state)
* `STATE_INVALID`: Transaction rejected as invalid (terminal state)

## CTF Operations

The relayer client enables you to execute Conditional Token Framework operations for your users:

### Split Positions

Split collateral tokens into conditional tokens representing different outcomes:

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Interface } from "ethers/lib/utils";
import { OperationType, SafeTransaction } from "@polymarket/builder-relayer-client";

const ctfInterface = new Interface([
    "function splitPosition(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] partition, uint amount)"
]);

const splitTx: SafeTransaction = {
    to: ctfAddress,
    operation: OperationType.Call,
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("splitPosition", [
        collateralToken,
        parentCollectionId,
        conditionId,
        partition,
        amount
    ]),
    value: "0"
};

const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions([splitTx], "Split position");
const result = await response.wait();
```

### Merge Positions

Merge conditional tokens back into collateral:

```typescript  theme={null}
const ctfInterface = new Interface([
    "function mergePositions(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] partition, uint amount)"
]);

const mergeTx: SafeTransaction = {
    to: ctfAddress,
    operation: OperationType.Call,
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("mergePositions", [
        collateralToken,
        parentCollectionId,
        conditionId,
        partition,
        amount
    ]),
    value: "0"
};

const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions([mergeTx], "Merge position");
const result = await response.wait();
```

### Redeem Positions

Redeem winning conditional tokens for collateral after market resolution:

```typescript  theme={null}
const ctfInterface = new Interface([
    "function redeemPositions(address collateralToken, bytes32 parentCollectionId, bytes32 conditionId, uint[] indexSets)"
]);

const redeemTx: SafeTransaction = {
    to: ctfAddress,
    operation: OperationType.Call,
    data: ctfInterface.encodeFunctionData("redeemPositions", [
        collateralToken,
        parentCollectionId,
        conditionId,
        indexSets
    ]),
    value: "0"
};

const response = await client.executeSafeTransactions([redeemTx], "Redeem position");
const result = await response.wait();
```

### Transaction Metadata

Use descriptive metadata to track transaction purposes:

<Tip>Metadata is limited to 500 characters or less </Tip>

```typescript  theme={null}
await client.executeSafeTransactions(
    transactions,
    "User deposit: 100 USDC for market ABC123"
);
```

## TypeScript Types

The relayer client is fully typed. Key types include:

```typescript  theme={null}
interface SafeTransaction {
    to: string;
    operation: OperationType;
    data: string;
    value: string;
}

enum OperationType {
    Call = 0,
    DelegateCall = 1
}

enum RelayerTransactionState {
    STATE_NEW = "STATE_NEW",
    STATE_EXECUTED = "STATE_EXECUTED",
    STATE_MINED = "STATE_MINED",
    STATE_CONFIRMED = "STATE_CONFIRMED",
    STATE_FAILED = "STATE_FAILED",
    STATE_INVALID = "STATE_INVALID"
}

interface RelayerTransaction {
    transactionID: string;
    transactionHash: string;
    from: string;
    to: string;
    proxyAddress: string;
    data: string;
    state: string;
    type: string;
    metadata: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
}
```

# CLOB Introduction

Welcome to the Polymarket Order Book API! This documentation provides overviews, explanations, examples, and annotations to simplify interaction with the order book. The following sections detail the Polymarket Order Book and the API usage.

## System

Polymarket's Order Book, or CLOB (Central Limit Order Book), is hybrid-decentralized. It includes an operator for off-chain matching/ordering, with settlement executed on-chain, non-custodially, via signed order messages.

The exchange uses a custom Exchange contract facilitating atomic swaps between binary Outcome Tokens (CTF ERC1155 assets and ERC20 PToken assets) and collateral assets (ERC20), following signed limit orders. Designed for binary markets, the contract enables complementary tokens to match across a unified order book.

Orders are EIP712-signed structured data. Matched orders have one maker and one or more takers, with price improvements benefiting the taker. The operator handles off-chain order management and submits matched trades to the blockchain for on-chain execution.

## API

The Polymarket Order Book API enables market makers and traders to programmatically manage market orders. Orders of any amount can be created, listed, fetched, or read from the market order books. Data includes all available markets, market prices, and order history via REST and WebSocket endpoints.

## Security

Polymarket's Exchange contract has been audited by Chainsecurity ([View Audit](https://github.com/Polymarket/ctf-exchange/blob/main/audit/ChainSecurity_Polymarket_Exchange_audit.pdf)).

The operator's privileges are limited to order matching, non-censorship, and ensuring correct ordering. Operators can't set prices or execute unauthorized trades. Users can cancel orders on-chain independently if trust issues arise.

## Fees

### Schedule

> Subject to change

| Volume Level | Maker Fee Base Rate (bps) | Taker Fee Base Rate (bps) |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| >0 USDC      | 0                         | 0                         |

### Overview

Fees apply symmetrically in output assets (proceeds). This symmetry ensures fairness and market integrity. Fees are calculated differently depending on whether you are buying or selling:

* **Selling outcome tokens (base) for collateral (quote):**

$$
feeQuote = baseRate \times \min(price, 1 - price) \times size
$$

* **Buying outcome tokens (base) with collateral (quote):**

$$
feeBase = baseRate \times \min(price, 1 - price) \times \frac{size}{price}
$$

## Order Utils

Polymarket has implemented utility libraries to programmatically sign and generate orders:

* [clob-order-utils](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-order-utils) (Typescript)
* [python-order-utils](https://github.com/Polymarket/python-order-utils) (Python)
* [go-order-utils](https://github.com/Polymarket/go-order-utils) (Golang)


# null

There are two levels of authentication to be considered when using PolymarketΓÇÖs CLOB.\
All signing can be handled directly by the client libraries.
<Tip>This is information for advanced users who are NOT using our [Python](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client) or [Typescript](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client) Clients. Our provided clients handle signing and authentication for you.</Tip>

## L1: Private Key Authentication

The highest level of authentication is via an accountΓÇÖs Polygon private key.\
The private key remains in control of a userΓÇÖs funds and all trading is non-custodial.\
The operator **never** has control over usersΓÇÖ funds.

Private key authentication is required for:

* Placing an order (for signing the order)
* Creating or revoking API keys

### L1 Header

| Header           | Required? | Description            |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| `POLY_ADDRESS`   | yes       | Polygon address        |
| `POLY_SIGNATURE` | yes       | CLOB EIP 712 signature |
| `POLY_TIMESTAMP` | yes       | Current UNIX timestamp |
| `POLY_NONCE`     | yes       | Nonce. Default 0       |

The `POLY_SIGNATURE` is generated by signing the following EIP-712 struct.

Implementations exist in:

* [Typescript](https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client/blob/main/src/signing/eip712.ts)
* [Python](https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client/blob/main/py_clob_client/signing/eip712.py)

### Signing Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python theme={null}
  domain = {
      "name": "ClobAuthDomain",
      "version": "1",
      "chainId": chainId,  # Polygon Chain ID 137
  }

  types = {
      "ClobAuth": [
          {"name": "address", "type": "address"},
          {"name": "timestamp", "type": "string"},
          {"name": "nonce", "type": "uint256"},
          {"name": "message", "type": "string"},
      ]
  }

  value = {
      "address": signingAddress,  # The signing address
      "timestamp": ts,            # The CLOB API server timestamp
      "nonce": nonce,             # The nonce used
      "message": "This message attests that I control the given wallet",
  }

  sig = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value)
  ```

  ```typescript Typescript theme={null}
  const domain = {
      name: "ClobAuthDomain",
      version: "1",
      chainId: chainId, // Polygon Chain ID 137
  };

  const types = {
      ClobAuth: [
          { name: "address", type: "address" },
          { name: "timestamp", type: "string" },
          { name: "nonce", type: "uint256" },
          { name: "message", type: "string" },
      ],
  };

  const value = {
      address: signingAddress, // The Signing address
      timestamp: ts,            // The CLOB API server timestamp
      nonce: nonce,             // The nonce used
      message: "This message attests that I control the given wallet", // Static message
  };

  const sig = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

## L2: API Key Authentication

The next level of authentication consists of the API key, secret, and passphrase.\
These are used solely to authenticate API requests made to PolymarketΓÇÖs CLOB, such as posting/canceling orders or retrieving an accountΓÇÖs orders and fills.

When a user on-boards via:

```bash  theme={null}
POST /auth/api-key
```

the server uses the signature as a seed to deterministically generate credentials.\
An API credential includes:

* `key`: UUID identifying the credentials
* `secret`: Secret string used to generate HMACs (not sent with requests)
* `passphrase`: Secret string sent with each request, used to encrypt/decrypt the secret (never stored)

All private endpoints require an API key signature (`L2 Header`).

### L2 Header

| Header            | Required? | Description                   |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `POLY_ADDRESS`    | yes       | Polygon address               |
| `POLY_SIGNATURE`  | yes       | HMAC signature for request    |
| `POLY_TIMESTAMP`  | yes       | Current UNIX timestamp        |
| `POLY_API_KEY`    | yes       | Polymarket API key            |
| `POLY_PASSPHRASE` | yes       | Polymarket API key passphrase |

# Orders Overview

> Detailed instructions for creating, placing, and managing orders using Polymarket's CLOB API.

All orders are expressed as limit orders (can be marketable). The underlying order primitive must be in the form expected and executable by the on-chain binary limit order protocol contract. Preparing such an order is quite involved (structuring, hashing, signing), thus Polymarket suggests using the open source typescript, python and golang libraries.

## Allowances

To place an order, allowances must be set by the funder address for the specified `maker` asset for the Exchange contract. When buying, this means the funder must have set a USDC allowance greater than or equal to the spending amount. When selling, the funder must have set an allowance for the conditional token that is greater than or equal to the selling amount. This allows the Exchange contract to execute settlement according to the signed order instructions created by a user and matched by the operator.

## Signature Types

PolymarketΓÇÖs CLOB supports 3 signature types. Orders must identify what signature type they use. The available typescript and python clients abstract the complexity of signing and preparing orders with the following signature types by allowing a funder address and signer type to be specified on initialization. The supported signature types are:

| Type               | ID | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| EOA                | 0  | EIP712 signature signed by an EOA                                                          |
| POLY\_PROXY        | 1  | EIP712 signatures signed by a signer associated with funding Polymarket proxy wallet       |
| POLY\_GNOSIS\_SAFE | 2  | EIP712 signatures signed by a signer associated with funding Polymarket gnosis safe wallet |

## Validity Checks

Orders are continually monitored to make sure they remain valid. Specifically, this includes continually tracking underlying balances, allowances and on-chain order cancellations. Any maker that is caught intentionally abusing these checks (which are essentially real time) will be blacklisted.

Additionally, there are rails on order placement in a market. Specifically, you can only place orders that sum to less than or equal to your available balance for each market. For example if you have 500 USDC in your funding wallet, you can place one order to buy 1000 YES in marketA @ \$.50, then any additional buy orders to that market will be rejected since your entire balance is reserved for the first (and only) buy order. More explicitly the max size you can place for an order is:

$$
\text{maxOrderSize} = \text{underlyingAssetBalance} - \sum(\text{orderSize} - \text{orderFillAmount})
$$



# Place Single Order

> Detailed instructions for creating, placing, and managing orders using Polymarket's CLOB API.

# Create and Place an Order

<Tip> This endpoint requires a L2 Header </Tip>

Create and place an order using the Polymarket CLOB API clients. All orders are represented as "limit" orders, but "market" orders are also supported. To place a market order, simply ensure your price is marketable against current resting limit orders, which are executed on input at the best price.

### Order types

* **FOK**: A Fill-Or-Kill order is an market order to buy (in dollars) or sell (in shares) shares that must be executed immediately in its entirety; otherwise, the entire order will be cancelled.
* **FAK**: A Fill-And-Kill order is a market order to buy (in dollars) or sell (in shares) that will be executed immediately for as many shares as are available; any portion not filled at once is cancelled.
* **GTC**: A Good-Til-Cancelled order is a limit order that is active until it is fulfilled or cancelled.
* **GTD**: A Good-Til-Date order is a type of order that is active until its specified date (UTC seconds timestamp), unless it has already been fulfilled or cancelled. There is a security threshold of one minute. If the order needs to expire in 90 seconds the correct expiration value is: now + 1 minute + 30 seconds

### Response Format

| Name        | Type      | Description                                                                                                                        |

### Insert Error Messages

If the `errorMsg` field of the response object from placement is not an empty string, the order was not able to be immediately placed. This might be because of a delay or because of a failure. If the `success` is not `true`, then there was an issue placing the order. The following `errorMessages` are possible:

#### Error

# Place Multiple Orders (Batching)

> Instructions for placing multiple orders(Batch)

<Tip> This endpoint requires a L2 Header </Tip>

PolymarketΓÇÖs CLOB supports batch orders, allowing you to place up to `15` orders in a single request. Before using this feature, make sure you're comfortable placing a single order first. You can find the documentation for that [here.](/developers/CLOB/orders/create-order)

**HTTP REQUEST**

`POST /<clob-endpoint>/orders`

* **FOK**: A Fill-Or-Kill order is an market order to buy (in dollars) or sell (in shares) shares that must be executed immediately in its entirety; otherwise, the entire order will be cancelled.
* **FAK**: A Fill-And-Kill order is a market order to buy (in dollars) or sell (in shares) that will be executed immediately for as many shares as are available; any portion not filled at once is cancelled.
* **GTC**: A Good-Til-Cancelled order is a limit order that is active until it is fulfilled or cancelled.
* **GTD**: A Good-Til-Date order is a type of order that is active until its specified date (UTC seconds timestamp), unless it has already been fulfilled or cancelled. There is a security threshold of one minute. If the order needs to expire in 90 seconds the correct expiration value is: now + 1 minute + 30 seconds

### Response Format

### Insert Error Messages

If the `errorMsg` field of the response object from placement is not an empty string, the order was not able to be immediately placed. This might be because of a delay or because of a failure. If the `success` is not `true`, then there was an issue placing the order. The following `errorMessages` are possible:

#### Error

# Onchain Order Info

## How do I interpret the OrderFilled onchain event?

Given an OrderFilled event:

* `orderHash`: a unique hash for the Order being filled
* `maker`: the user generating the order and the source of funds for the order
* `taker`: the user filling the order OR the Exchange contract if the order fills multiple limit orders
* `makerAssetId`: id of the asset that is given out. If 0, indicates that the Order is a BUY, giving USDC in exchange for Outcome tokens. Else, indicates that the Order is a SELL, giving Outcome tokens in exchange for USDC.
* `takerAssetId`: id of the asset that is received. If 0, indicates that the Order is a SELL, receiving USDC in exchange for Outcome tokens. Else, indicates that the Order is a BUY, receiving Outcome tokens in exchange for USDC.
* `makerAmountFilled`: the amount of the asset that is given out.
* `takerAmountFilled`: the amount of the asset that is received.
* `fee`: the fees paid by the order maker



# Trades Overview

## Overview

All historical trades can be fetched via the Polymarket CLOB REST API. A trade is initiated by a "taker" who creates a marketable limit order. This limit order can be matched against one or more resting limit orders on the associated book. A trade can be in various states as described below. Note: in some cases (due to gas limitations) the execution of a "trade" must be broken into multiple transactions which case separate trade entities will be returned. To associate trade entities, there is a bucket\_index field and a match\_time field. Trades that have been broken into multiple trade objects can be reconciled by combining trade objects with the same market\_order\_id, match\_time and incrementing bucket\_index's into a top level "trade" client side.

# WSS Overview

> Overview and general information about the Polymarket Websocket

## Overview

The Polymarket CLOB API provides websocket (wss) channels through which clients can get pushed updates. These endpoints allow clients to maintain almost real-time views of their orders, their trades and markets in general. There are two available channels `user` and `market`.

## Subscription

To subscribe send a message including the following authentication and intent information upon opening the connection.

| Field       | Type      | Description                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| auth        | Auth      | see next page for auth information                                          |
| markets     | string\[] | array of markets (condition IDs) to receive events for (for `user` channel) |
| assets\_ids | string\[] | array of asset ids (token IDs) to receive events for (for `market` channel) |
| type        | string    | id of channel to subscribe to (USER or MARKET)                              |

Where the `auth` field is of type `Auth` which has the form described in the WSS Authentication section below.



# WSS Quickstart

The following code samples and explanation will show you how to subsribe to the Marker and User channels of the Websocket.
You'll need your API keys to do this so we'll start with that.

## Getting your API Keys

<CodeGroup>
  ```python DeriveAPIKeys-Python [expandable] theme={null}
  from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient

  host: str = "https://clob.polymarket.com"
  key: str = "" #This is your Private Key. If using email login export from https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket otherwise export from your Web3 Application
  chain_id: int = 137 #No need to adjust this
  POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS: str = '' #This is the address you deposit/send USDC to to FUND your Polymarket account.

  #Select from the following 3 initialization options to matches your login method, and remove any unused lines so only one client is initialized.

  ### Initialization of a client using a Polymarket Proxy associated with an Email/Magic account. If you login with your email use this example.
  client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, signature_type=1, funder=POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS)

  ### Initialization of a client using a Polymarket Proxy associated with a Browser Wallet(Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc)
  client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id, signature_type=2, funder=POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS)

  ### Initialization of a client that trades directly from an EOA. 
  client = ClobClient(host, key=key, chain_id=chain_id)

  print( client.derive_api_key() )

  ```

  ```javascript DeriveAPIKeys-TS [expandable] theme={null}
  //npm install @polymarket/clob-client
  //npm install ethers
  //Client initialization example and dumping API Keys
  import {ClobClient, ApiKeyCreds } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
  import { Wallet } from "@ethersproject/wallet";

  const host = 'https://clob.polymarket.com';
  const signer = new Wallet("YourPrivateKey"); //This is your Private Key. If using email login export from https://reveal.magic.link/polymarket otherwise export from your Web3 Application

  // Initialize the clob client
  // NOTE: the signer must be approved on the CTFExchange contract
  const clobClient = new ClobClient(host, 137, signer);

  (async () => {
    const apiKey = await clobClient.deriveApiKey();
    console.log(apiKey);
  })();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Using those keys to connect to the Market or User Websocket

<CodeGroup>
  ```python WSS-Connection [expandable] theme={null}

              time.sleep(10)

      def run(self):
          self.ws.run_forever()


  if __name__ == "__main__":

      condition_ids = [] # no really need to filter by this one

      auth = {"apiKey": api_key, "secret": api_secret, "passphrase": api_passphrase}

      market_connection = WebSocketOrderBook(
          MARKET_CHANNEL, url, asset_ids, auth, None, True
      )
      user_connection = WebSocketOrderBook(
          USER_CHANNEL, url, condition_ids, auth, None, True
      )

      market_connection.run()
      # user_connection.run()
  ```
</CodeGroup>



# WSS Authentication

# Real Time Data Socket

## Overview

The Polymarket Real-Time Data Socket (RTDS) is a WebSocket-based streaming service that provides real-time updates for various Polymarket data streams. The service allows clients to subscribe to multiple data feeds simultaneously and receive live updates as events occur on the platform.

<Note>Polymarket provides a Typescript client for interacting with this streaming service. [Download and view it's documentation here](https://github.com/Polymarket/real-time-data-client)</Note>

### Connection Details

* **WebSocket URL**: `wss://ws-live-data.polymarket.com`
* **Protocol**: WebSocket
* **Data Format**: JSON

### Authentication

The RTDS supports two types of authentication depending on the subscription type:

1. **CLOB Authentication**: Required for certain trading-related subscriptions
   * `key`: API key
   * `secret`: API secret
   * `passphrase`: API passphrase

2. **Gamma Authentication**: Required for user-specific data
   * `address`: User wallet address

### Connection Management

The WebSocket connection supports:

* **Dynamic Subscriptions**: Without disconnecting from the socket users can add, remove and modify topics and filters they are subscribed to.
* **Ping/Pong**: You should send PING messages (every 5 seconds ideally) to maintain connection

## Available Subscription Types

<Note>Although this connection technically supports additional activity and subscription types, they are not fully supported at this time. Users are free to use them but there may be some unexpected behavior.</Note>

The RTDS currently supports the following subscription types:

1. **[Crypto Prices](/developers/RTDS/RTDS-crypto-prices)** - Real-time cryptocurrency price updates
2. **[Comments](/developers/RTDS/RTDS-comments)** - Comment-related events including reactions

## Message Structure

All messages received from the WebSocket follow this structure:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "topic": "string",
  "type": "string", 
  "timestamp": "number",
  "payload": "object"
}
```

* `topic`: The subscription topic (e.g., "crypto\_prices", "comments", "activity")
* `type`: The message type/event (e.g., "update", "reaction\_created", "orders\_matched")
* `timestamp`: Unix timestamp in milliseconds
* `payload`: Event-specific data object

## Subscription Management

### Subscribe to Topics

To subscribe to data streams, send a JSON message with this structure:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "action": "subscribe",
  "subscriptions": [
    {
      "topic": "topic_name",
      "type": "message_type",
      "filters": "optional_filter_string",
      "clob_auth": {
        "key": "api_key",
        "secret": "api_secret", 
        "passphrase": "api_passphrase"
      },
      "gamma_auth": {
        "address": "wallet_address"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Unsubscribe from Topics

To unsubscribe from data streams, send a similar message with `"action": "unsubscribe"`.

## Error Handling

* Connection errors will trigger automatic reconnection attempts
* Invalid subscription messages may result in connection closure
* Authentication failures will prevent successful subscription to protected topics



# RTDS Crypto Prices

## Comment Hierarchy

Comments support nested threading:

* **Top-level comments**: `parentCommentID` is null or empty
* **Reply comments**: `parentCommentID` contains the ID of the parent comment
* All comments are associated with a `parentEntityID` and `parentEntityType`

## Use Cases

* Real-time comment feed displays
* Discussion thread monitoring
* Community sentiment analysis

## Content

* Comments include `reactionCount` and `reportCount`
* Comment body contains the full text content

## Notes

* The `createdAt` timestamp uses ISO 8601 format with timezone information
* The outer `timestamp` field represents when the WebSocket message was sent
* User profiles include both primary addresses and proxy wallet addresses



# Gamma Structure

All market data necessary for market resolution is available on-chain (ie ancillaryData in UMA 00 request), but Polymarket also provides a hosted service, Gamma, that indexes this data and provides additional market metadata (ie categorization, indexed volume, etc). This service is made available through a REST API. For public users, this resource read only and can be used to fetch useful information about markets for things like non-profit research projects, alternative trading interfaces, automated trading systems etc.

# Endpoint

[https://gamma-api.polymarket.com](https://gamma-api.polymarket.com)


# Gamma Structure

Gamma provides some organizational models. These include events, and markets. The most fundamental element is always markets and the other models simply provide additional organization.

# Detail

1. **Market**
   1. Contains data related to a market that is traded on. Maps onto a pair of clob token ids, a market address, a question id and a condition id

2. **Event**
   1. Contains a set of markets
   2. Variants:
      1. Event with 1 market (i.e., resulting in an SMP)
      2. Event with 2 or more markets (i.e., resulting in an GMP)

# Example

* **\[Event]** Where will Barron Trump attend College?
  * **\[Market]** Will Barron attend Georgetown?
  * **\[Market]** Will Barron attend NYU?
  * **\[Market]** Will Barron attend UPenn?
  * **\[Market]** Will Barron attend Harvard?
  * **\[Market]** Will Barron attend another college?
  
  
# How to Fetch Markets

<Tip>Both the getEvents and getMarkets are paginated. See [pagination section](#pagination) for details.</Tip>
This guide covers the three recommended approaches for fetching market data from the Gamma API, each optimized for different use cases.

## Overview

There are three main strategies for retrieving market data:

1. **By Slug** - Best for fetching specific individual markets or events
2. **By Tags** - Ideal for filtering markets by category or sport
3. **Via Events Endpoint** - Most efficient for retrieving all active markets

***

## 1. Fetch by Slug

**Use Case:** When you need to retrieve a specific market or event that you already know about.

Individual markets and events are best fetched using their unique slug identifier. The slug can be found directly in the Polymarket frontend URL.

### How to Extract the Slug

From any Polymarket URL, the slug is the path segment after `/event/` or `/market/`:

```
https://polymarket.com/event/fed-decision-in-october?tid=1758818660485
                            Γåæ
                  Slug: fed-decision-in-october
```

### API Endpoints

**For Events:** [GET /events/slug/{slug}](/api-reference/events/list-events)

**For Markets:** [GET /markets/slug/{slug}](/api-reference/markets/list-markets)

### Examples

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events/slug/fed-decision-in-october"
```

***

## 2. Fetch by Tags

**Use Case:** When you want to filter markets by category, sport, or topic.

Tags provide a powerful way to categorize and filter markets. You can discover available tags and then use them to filter your market requests.

### Discover Available Tags

**General Tags:** [GET /tags](/api-reference/tags/list-tags)

**Sports Tags & Metadata:** [GET /sports](/api-reference/sports/get-sports-metadata-information)

The `/sports` endpoint returns comprehensive metadata for sports including tag IDs, images, resolution sources, and series information.

### Using Tags in Market Requests

Once you have tag IDs, you can use them with the `tag_id` parameter in both markets and events endpoints.

**Markets with Tags:** [GET /markets](/api-reference/markets/list-markets)

**Events with Tags:** [GET /events](/api-reference/events/list-events)

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?tag_id=100381&limit=1&closed=false"

```

### Additional Tag Filtering

You can also:

* Use `related_tags=true` to include related tag markets
* Exclude specific tags with `exclude_tag_id`

***

## 3. Fetch All Active Markets

**Use Case:** When you need to retrieve all available active markets, typically for broader analysis or market discovery.

The most efficient approach is to use the `/events` endpoint and work backwards, as events contain their associated markets.

**Events Endpoint:** [GET /events](/api-reference/events/list-events)

**Markets Endpoint:** [GET /markets](/api-reference/markets/list-markets)

### Key Parameters

* `order=id` - Order by event ID
* `ascending=false` - Get newest events first
* `closed=false` - Only active markets
* `limit` - Control response size
* `offset` - For pagination

### Examples

```bash  theme={null}
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?order=id&ascending=false&closed=false&limit=100"
```

This approach gives you all active markets ordered from newest to oldest, allowing you to systematically process all available trading opportunities.

### Pagination

For large datasets, use pagination with `limit` and `offset` parameters:

* `limit=50` - Return 50 results per page
* `offset=0` - Start from the beginning (increment by limit for subsequent pages)

**Pagination Examples:**

```bash  theme={null}
# Page 1: First 50 results (offset=0)
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?order=id&ascending=false&closed=false&limit=50&offset=0"
```

```bash  theme={null}
# Page 2: Next 50 results (offset=50)
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?order=id&ascending=false&closed=false&limit=50&offset=50"
```

```bash  theme={null}
# Page 3: Next 50 results (offset=100)
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?order=id&ascending=false&closed=false&limit=50&offset=100"
```

```bash  theme={null}
# Paginating through markets with tag filtering
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?tag_id=100381&closed=false&limit=25&offset=0"
```

```bash  theme={null}
# Next page of markets with tag filtering
curl "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?tag_id=100381&closed=false&limit=25&offset=25"
```

***

## Best Practices

1. **For Individual Markets:** Always use the slug method for best performance
2. **For Category Browsing:** Use tag filtering to reduce API calls
3. **For Complete Market Discovery:** Use the events endpoint with pagination
4. **Always Include `closed=false`:** Unless you specifically need historical data
5. **Implement Rate Limiting:** Respect API limits for production applications

## Subgraph Overview

Polymarket has written and open sourced a subgraph that provides, via a GraphQL query interface, useful aggregate calculations and event indexing for things like volume, user position, market and liquidity data. The subgraph updates in real time to be able to be mixed, and match core data from the primary Polymarket interface, providing positional data, activity history and more. The subgraph can be hosted by anyone but is also hosted and made publicly available by a 3rd party provider, Goldsky.

## Source

The Polymarket subgraph is entirely open source and can be found on the Polymarket Github.

**[Subgraph Github Repository](https://github.com/Polymarket/polymarket-subgraph)**

> Note: The available models/schemas can be found in the `schema.graphql` file.

## Hosted Version

The subgraphs are hosted on goldsky, each with an accompanying GraphQL playground:

# Resolution

# UMA Optimistic Oracle Integration

## Overview

Polymarket leverages UMA's Optimistic Oracle (OO) to resolve arbitrary questions, permissionlessly. From [UMA's docs](https://docs.uma.xyz/protocol-overview/how-does-umas-oracle-work):

"UMA's Optimistic Oracle allows contracts to quickly request and receive data information ... The Optimistic Oracle acts as a generalized escalation game between contracts that initiate a price request and UMA's dispute resolution system known as the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM). Prices proposed by the Optimistic Oracle will not be sent to the DVM unless it is disputed. If a dispute is raised, a request is sent to the DVM. All contracts built on UMA use the DVM as a backstop to resolve disputes. Disputes sent to the DVM will be resolved within a few days -- after UMA tokenholders vote on what the correct outcome should have been."

To allow CTF markets to be resolved via the OO, Polymarket developed a custom adapter contract called `UmaCtfAdapter` that provides a way for the two contract systems to interface.

## Clarifications

Recent versions (v2+) of the `UmaCtfAdapter` also include a bulletin board feature that allows market creators to issue "clarifications". Questions that allow updates will include the sentence in their ancillary data:

"Updates made by the question creator via the bulletin board on 0x6A5D0222186C0FceA7547534cC13c3CFd9b7b6A4F74 should be considered. In summary, clarifications that do not impact the question's intent should be considered."

Where the [transaction](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xa14f01b115c4913624fc3f508f960f4dea252758e73c28f5f07f8e19d7bca066) reference outlining what outlining should be considered.

## Resolution Process

### Actions

* **Initiate** - Binary CTF markets are initialized via the `UmaCtfAdapter`'s `initialize()` function. This stores the question parameters on the contract, prepares the CTF and requests a price for a question from the OO. It returns a `questionID` that is also used to reference on the `UmaCtfAdapter`. The caller provides:
  1. `ancillaryData` - data used to resolve a question (i.e the question + clarifications)
  2. `rewardToken` - ERC20 token address used for payment of rewards and fees
  3. `reward` - Reward amount offered to a successful proposer. The caller must have set allowance so that the contract can pull this reward in.
  4. `proposalBond` - Bond required to be posted by OO proposers/disputers. If 0, the default OO bond is used.
  5. `liveness` - UMA liveness period in seconds. If 0, the default liveness period is used.

* **Propose Price** - Anyone can then propose a price to the question on the OO. To do this they must post the `proposalBond`. The liveness period begins after a price is proposed.

* **Dispute** - Anyone that disagrees with the proposed price has the opportunity to dispute the price by posting a counter bond via the OO, this proposed will now be escalated to the DVM for a voter-wide vote.

### Possible Flows

When the first proposed price is disputed for a `questionID` on the adapter, a callback is made and posted as the reward for this new proposal. This means a second `questionID`, making a new `questionID` to the OO (the reward is returned before the callback is made and posted as the reward for this new proposal). This allows for a second round of resolution, and correspondingly a second dispute is required for it to go to the DVM. The thinking behind this is to doubles the cost of a potential griefing vector (two disputes are required just one) and also allows far-fetched (incorrect) first price proposals to not delay the resolution. As such there are two possible flows:

* **Initialize (CTFAdapter) -> Propose (OO) -> Resolve (CTFAdapter)**
* **Initialize (CTFAdaptor) -> Propose (OO) -> Challenge (OO) -> Propose (OO) -> Resolve (CTFAdaptor)**
* **Initialize (CTFAdaptor) -> Propose (OO) -> Challenge (OO) -> Propose (OO) -> Challenge (CtfAdapter) -> Resolve (CTFAdaptor)**

# Liquidity Rewards

> Polymarket provides incentives aimed at catalyzing the supply and demand side of the marketplace. Specifically there is a public liquidity rewards program as well as one-off public pnl/volume competitions.

## Overview

By posting resting limit orders, liquidity providers (makers) are automatically eligible for Polymarket's incentive program. The overall goal of this program is to catalyze a healthy, liquid marketplace. We can further define this as creating incentives that:

* Catalyze liquidity across all markets
* Encourage liquidity throughout a market's entire lifecycle
* Motivate passive, balanced quoting tight to a market's mid-point
* Encourages trading activity
* Discourages blatantly exploitative behaviors

This program is heavily inspired by dYdX's liquidity provider rewards which you can read more about [here](https://www.dydx.foundation/blog/liquidity-provider-rewards). In fact, the incentive methodology is essentially a copy of dYdX's successful methodology but with some adjustments including specific adaptations for binary contract markets with distinct books, no staking mechanic a slightly modified order utility-relative depth function and reward amounts isolated per market. Rewards are distributed directly to the maker's addresses daily at midnight UTC.

## Methodology

Polymarket liquidity providers will be rewarded based on a formula that rewards participation in markets (complementary consideration!), boosts two-sided depth (single-sided orders still score), and spread (vs. mid-market, adjusted for the size cutoff!). Each market still configure a max spread and min size cutoff within which orders are considered the average of rewards earned is determined by the relative share of each participant's Q<sub>n</sub> in market m.

**Equation 4:**

**Equation 4a:**

If midpoint is in range \[0.10,0.90] allow single sided liq to score:

$Q_{\min} = \max(\min({Q_{one}, Q_{two}}), \max(Q_{one}/c, Q_{two}/c))$

**Equation 4b:**

If midpoint is in either range \[0,0.10) or (.90,1.0] require liq to be double sided to score:

$Q_{\min} = \min({Q_{one}, Q_{two}})$

**Equation 5:**

$Q_{normal} = \frac{Q_{min}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}{(Q_{min})_n}}$

**Equation 6:**

$Q_{epoch} = \sum_{u=1}^{10,080}{(Q_{normal})_u}$

**Equation 7:**

$Q_{final}=\frac{Q_{epoch}}{\sum_{n=1}^{N}{(Q_{epoch})_n}}$

## Steps

1. Quadratic scoring rule for an order based on position between the adjusted midpoint and the minimum qualifying spread

2. Calculate first market side score. Assume a trader has the following open orders:

   * 100Q bid on m @0.49 (adjusted midpoint is 0.50 then spread of this order is 0.01 or 1c)
   * 200Q bid on m @0.48
   * 100Q ask on m' @0.51

   and assume an adjusted market midpoint of 0.50 and maxSpread config of 3c for both m and m'. Then the trader's score is:

   $$
   Q_{ne} = \left( \frac{(3-1)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-2)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 200 + \left( \frac{(3-1)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100
   $$

   $Q_{ne}$ is calculated every minute using random sampling

3. Calculate second market side score. Assume a trader has the following open orders:

   * 100Q bid on m @0.485
   * 100Q bid on m' @0.48
   * 200Q ask on m' @0.505

   and assume an adjusted market midpoint of 0.50 and maxSpread config of 3c for both m and m'. Then the trader's score is:

   $$
   Q_{no} = \left( \frac{(3-1.5)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-2)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 100 + \left( \frac{(3-.5)}{3} \right)^2 \cdot 200
   $$

   $Q_{no}$ is calculated every minute using random sampling

4. Boosts 2-sided liquidity by taking the minimum of $Q_{ne}$ and $Q_{no}$, and rewards 1-side liquidity at a reduced rate (divided by c)

   Calculated every minute

5. $Q_{normal}$ is the $Q_{min}$ of a market maker divided by the sum of all the $Q_{min}$ of other market makers in a given sample

6. $Q_{epoch}$ is the sum of all $Q_{normal}$ for a trader in a given epoch

7. $Q_{final}$ normalizes $Q_{epoch}$ by dividing it by the sum of all other market maker's $Q_{epoch}$ in a given epoch this value is multiplied by the rewards available for the market to get a trader's reward

<Tip>Both min\_incentive\_size and max\_incentive\_spread can be fetched alongside full market objects via both the CLOB API and Markets API. Reward allocations for an epoch can be fetched via the Markets API. </Tip>



# Overview

All outcomes on Polymarket are tokenized on the Polygon network. Specifically, Polymarket outcomes shares are binary outcomes (ie "YES" and "NO") using Gnosis' Conditional Token Framework (CTF). They are distinct ERC1155 tokens related to a parent condition and backed by the same collateral. More technically, the binary outcome tokens are referred to as "positionIds" in Gnosis's documentation. "PositionIds" are derived from a collateral token and distinct "collectionIds". "CollectionIds" are derived from a "parentCollectionId", (always bytes32(0) in our case) a "conditionId", and a unique "indexSet".

The "indexSet" is a 256 bit array denoting which outcome slots are in an outcome collection; it MUST be a nonempty proper subset of a condition's outcome slots. In the binary case, which we are interested in, there are two "indexSets", one for the first outcome and one for the second. The first outcome's "indexSet" is 0b01 = 1 and the second's is 0b10 = 2. The parent "conditionId" (shared by both "collectionIds" and therefore "positionIds") is derived from a "questionId" (a hash of the UMA ancillary data), an "oracle" (the UMA adapter V2), and an "outcomeSlotCount" (always 2 in the binary case). The steps for calculating the ERC1155 token ids (positionIds) is as follows:

1. Get the conditionId
   1. Function:
      1. `getConditionId(oracle, questionId, outcomeSlotCount)`
   2. Inputs:
      1. `oracle`: address - UMA adapter V2
      2. `questionId`: bytes32 - hash of the UMA ancillary data
      3. `outcomeSlotCount`: uint - 2 for binary markets

2. Get the two collectionIds
   1. Function:
      1. `getCollectionId(parentCollectionId, conditionId, indexSet)`
   2. Inputs:
      1. `parentCollectionId`: bytes32 - bytes32(0)
      2. `conditionId`: bytes32 - the conditionId derived from (1)
      3. `indexSet`: uint - 1 (0b01) for the first and 2 (0b10) for the second.

3. Get the two positionIds
   1. Function:
      1. `getPositionId(collateralToken, collectionId)`
   2. Inputs:
      1. `collateralToken`: IERC20 - address of ERC20 token collateral (USDC)
      2. `collectionId`: bytes32 - the two collectionIds derived from (3)

Leveraging the relations above, specifically "conditionIds" -> "positionIds" the Gnosis CTF contract allows for "splitting" and "merging" full outcome sets. We explore these actions and provide code examples below.



# Splitting USDC

At any time, after a condition has been prepared on the CTF contract (via `prepareCondition`), it is possible to "split" collateral into a full (position) set. In other words, one unit USDC can be split into 1 YES unit and 1 NO unit. If splitting from the collateral, the CTF contract will attempt to transfer `amount` collateral from the message sender to itself. If successful, `amount` stake will be minted in the split target positions. If any of the transfers, mints, or burns fail, the transaction will revert. The transaction will also revert if the given partition is trivial, invalid, or refers to more slots than the condition is prepared with. This operation happens via the `splitPosition()` function on the CTF contract with the following parameters:

* `collateralToken`: IERC20 - The address of the positions' backing collateral token.
* `parentCollectionId`: bytes32 - The ID of the outcome collections common to the position being split and the split target positions. Null in Polymarket case.
* `conditionId`: bytes32 - The ID of the condition to split on.
* `partition`: uint\[] - An array of disjoint index sets representing a nontrivial partition of the outcome slots of the given condition. E.G. A|B and C but not A|B and B|C (is not disjoint). Each element's a number which, together with the condition, represents the outcome collection. E.G. 0b110 is A|B, 0b010 is B, etc. In the Polymarket case 1|2.
* `amount` - The amount of collateral or stake to split. Also the number of full sets to receive.



# Merging Tokens

In addition to splitting collateral for a full set, the inverse can also happen; a full set can be "merged" for collateral. This operation can again happen at any time after a condition has been prepared on the CTF contract. One unit of each position in a full set is burned in return for 1 collateral unit. This operation happens via the `mergePositions()` function on the CTF contract with the following parameters:

* `collateralToken`: IERC20 - The address of the positions' backing collateral token.
* `parentCollectionId`: bytes32 - The ID of the outcome collections common to the position being merged and the merge target positions. Null in Polymarket case.
* `conditionId`: bytes32 - The ID of the condition to merge on.
* `partition`: uint\[] - An array of disjoint index sets representing a nontrivial partition of the outcome slots of the given condition. E.G. A|B and C but not A|B and B|C (is not disjoint). Each element's a number which, together with the condition, represents the outcome collection. E.G. 0b110 is A|B, 0b010 is B, etc. In the Polymarket case 1|2.
* `amount` - The number of full sets to merge. Also the amount of collateral to receive.



# Reedeeming Tokens

Once a condition has had it's payouts reported (ie by the UMACTFAdapter calling `reportPayouts` on the CTF contract), users with shares in the winning outcome can redeem them for the underlying collateral. Specifically, users can call the `redeemPositions` function on the CTF contract which will burn all valuable conditional tokens in return for collateral according to the reported payout vector. This function has the following parameters:

* `collateralToken`: IERC20 - The address of the positions' backing collateral token.
* `parentCollectionId`: bytes32 - The ID of the outcome collections common to the position being redeemed. Null in Polymarket case.
* `indexSets`: uint\[] - The ID of the condition to redeem.
* `indexSets`: uint\[] - An array of disjoint index sets representing a nontrivial partition of the outcome slots of the given condition. E.G. A|B and C but not A|B and B|C (is not disjoint). Each element's a number which, together with the condition, represents the outcome collection. E.G. 0b110 is A|B, 0b010 is B, etc. In the Polymarket case 1|2.

Polymarket provides code samples in both Python and TypeScript for interacting
with our smart chain contracts. You will need an RPC endpoint to access the
blockchain, and you'll be responsible for paying gas fees when executing these
RPC/function calls. Please ensure you're using the correct example for your wallet
type (Safe Wallet vs Proxy Wallet) when implementing.

## Overview

When a user first uses Polymarket.com to trade they are prompted to create a wallet. When they do this, a 1 of 1 multisig is deployed to Polygon which is controlled/owned by the accessing EOA (either MetaMask wallet or MagicLink wallet). This proxy wallet is where all the user's positions (ERC1155) and USDC (ERC20) are held.

Using proxy wallets allows Polymarket to provide an improved UX where multi-step transactions can be executed atomically and transactions can be relayed by relayers on the gas station network. If you are a developer looking to programmatically access positions you accumulated via the Polymarket.com interface, you can either continue using the smart contract wallet by executing transactions through it from the owner account, or you can transfer these assets to a new address using the owner account.

***

## Deployments

Each user has their own proxy wallet (and thus proxy wallet address) but the factories are available at the following deployed addresses on the **Polygon network**:

# Overview

Certain events which meet the criteria of being "winner-take-all" may be deployed as **"negative risk"** events/markets. The Gamma API includes a boolean field on events, `negRisk`, which indicates whether the event is negative risk.

Negative risk allows for increased capital efficiency by relating all markets within events via a convert action. More explicitly, a NO share in any market can be converted into 1 YES share in all other markets. Converts can be exercised via the [Negative Adapter](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296). You can read more about negative risk [here](https://github.com/Polymarket/neg-risk-ctf-adapter).

***

## Augmented Negative Risk

There is a known issue with the negative risk architecture which is that the outcome universe must be complete before conversions are made or otherwise conversion will ΓÇ£costΓÇ¥ something. In most cases, the outcome universe can be made complete by deploying all the named outcomes and then an ΓÇ£otherΓÇ¥ option. But in some cases this is undesirable as new outcomes can come out of nowhere and you'd rather them be directly named versus grouped together in an ΓÇ£otherΓÇ¥.

To fix this, some markets use a system of **"augmented negative risk"**, where named outcomes, a collection of unnamed outcomes, and an *other* is deployed. When a new outcome needs to be added, an unnamed outcome can be clarified to be the new outcome via the bulletin board. This means the ΓÇ£otherΓÇ¥ in the case of augmented negative risk can effectively change definitions (outcomes can be taken out of it).

As such, trading should only happen on the named outcomes, and the other outcomes should be ignored until they are named or until resolution occurs. The Polymarket UI will not show unnamed outcomes.

If a market becomes resolvable and the correct outcome is not named (originally or via placeholder clarification), it should resolve to the *ΓÇ£otherΓÇ¥* outcome. An event can be considered ΓÇ£augmented negative riskΓÇ¥ when `enableNegRisk` is true **AND** `negRiskAugmented` is true.

The naming conventions are as follows:

### Original Outcomes

* Outcome A
* Outcome B
* ...

### Placeholder Outcomes

* Person A -> can be clarified to a named outcome
* Person B -> can be clarified to a named outcome
* ...

### Explicit Other

* Other -> not meant to be traded as the definition of this changes as placeholder outcomes are clarified to named outcomes

  <strong>≡ƒÜ¿ Breaking Change:</strong> This change goes live on <strong>September 15, 2025 at 11PM UTC</strong>. Please upgrade your implementation as soon as possible to avoid service disruption.
</div>

## Overview

* The `price_change` message schema in the Market Channel WebSocket has been updated to improve websocket performance and reliability.
* Messages now come in the form of objects as opposed to lists of fields.

## What's Changed

**Before (Legacy Schema):**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "asset_id": "71321045679252212594626385532706912750332728571942532289631379312455583992563",
  "changes": [
    {
      "price": "0.4",
      "side": "SELL", 
      "size": "3300"
    }
  ],
  "event_type": "price_change",
  "market": "0x5f65177b394277fd294cd75650044e32ba009a95022d88a0c1d565897d72f8f1",
  "timestamp": "1729084877448",
  "hash": "3cd4d61e042c81560c9037ece0c61f3b1a8fbbdd"
}
```

**After (New Schema):**

```json  theme={null}
{
    "market": "0x5f65177b394277fd294cd75650044e32ba009a95022d88a0c1d565897d72f8f1",
    "price_changes": [
        {
            "asset_id": "71321045679252212594626385532706912750332728571942532289631379312455583992563",
            "price": "0.5",
            "size": "200",
            "side": "BUY",
            "hash": "56621a121a47ed9333273e21c83b660cff37ae50",
            "best_bid": "0.5",
            "best_ask": "1"
        },
        {
            "asset_id": "52114319501245915516055106046884209969926127482827954674443846427813813222426",
            "price": "0.5",
            "size": "200",
            "side": "SELL",
            "hash": "1895759e4df7a796bf4f1c5a5950b748306923e2",
            "best_bid": "0",
            "best_ask": "0.5"
        }
    ],
    "timestamp": "1757908892351",
    "event_type": "price_change"
}
```

### Key Differences

| Aspect                   | Legacy Schema | New Schema                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Root level asset\_id** | Present       | Removed                         |
| **Changes array**        | `changes`     | `price_changes`                 |
| **Asset ID location**    | Root level    | Inside each price change object |
| **Hash location**        | Root level    | Inside each price change object |
| **Best bid/ask**         | Not included  | Included in each change         |
| **Side values**          | "SELL", "BUY" | "SELL", "BUY" (unchanged)       |

## Handle New Fields

The new schema provides additional market data:

* **`best_bid`**: Current best bid price for the asset
* **`best_ask`**: Current best ask price for the asset
* **`hash`**: Now provided per price change rather than per message

## Benefits of the New Schema

* **Enhanced market data**: Best bid/ask prices are now included
* **Granular change tracking**: Hash values are provided per change rather than per message
* **Clearer structure**: The reorganized schema makes the relationship between market, assets, and changes more explicit

## Timeline

* **Go-live**: **September 15, 2025 at 11PM UTC**
* **Legacy support**: None, these changes are not backwards compatible

## Testing Your Migration

1. **Update your parsing logic** following the examples above
2. **Verify handling of new fields** like `best_bid` and `best_ask`
3. **Check error handling** for the new structure

## Support
